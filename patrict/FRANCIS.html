            <p>*High Ammo Capacity*: Francis can carry more ammunition for his weapons, allowing him to sustain firefights for longer durations without running out of bullets.<br><br>
     *Versatile Weaponry*: Francis can wield a wide range of firearms effectively, giving players flexibility in choosing their preferred playstyle.<br><br>
       *Resilience*: While not confirmed in-game, Francis is depicted as a tough and rugged biker, suggesting he may have higher resistance to damage, though this isn't explicitly reflected in gameplay mechanics.</p>

  <h1>DISADANTAGES OF FRANCIS:</h1>

         <p>*Negative Attitude*: Francis often complains about various aspects of the apocalypse, which can sometimes bring down team morale and create tension among teammates.<br><br>
        *Lack of Healing Abilities*: Unlike some other survivors, Francis doesn't possess any unique healing abilities or bonuses, relying solely on health kits and pills for recovery.<br><br>
        *Limited Mobility*: Similar to other survivors, Francis may struggle with slower movement speed and larger hitbox, making him somewhat less agile in certain situations.</p>
