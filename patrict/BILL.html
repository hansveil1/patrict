*No Unique Abilities*: Bill lacks any unique special abilities or bonuses, relying solely on standard gameplay mechanics and teamwork to survive.<br><br>
*Limited Health*: Like other survivors, Bill has a finite amount of health and can be incapacitated if he sustains too much damage, requiring assistance from teammates to revive him.</p>
