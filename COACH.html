  <h1>DISADANTAGES OF COACH:</h1>
        
            <p> *Slower Speed*: Coach is generally slower than other survivors, which can make it challenging for him to keep up with the team during fast-paced escapes.<br><br>
 *Limited Mobility*: His larger size can sometimes make it harder for Coach to navigate through tight spaces or evade incoming attacks.<br><br>
 *Reliance on Close Combat*: While effective in melee combat, Coach may struggle against long-range threats without appropriate firearms or support from teammates.
